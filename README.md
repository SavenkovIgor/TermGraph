# ‚ö°Ô∏è Description
TermGraph is a terms diagram builder. This app helps to arrange terms from simple <br>
to complex and build a map of definitions. <br>

## What for?
**Short answer:** This will help you learn something new faster and with deep understanding.

**Long anser:**
In all well-structured areas of knowledge, it is easy to see how explanations <br>
are built up on each other. <br>
The most basic concepts are easily accessible to any beginner. More complex <br>
concepts require more effort and are always explained in terms of simpler ones.

If you try to draw the first few "layers" of these terms, it will look like <br>
a ladder or lasagna) If you draw them all, you will get a knowledge area map, which <br>
can be very useful.

### Benefits for beginners (if you don't have the map yet)
- Its construction guaranteed learning with active memorization
- Wikipedia wandering can become a good teacher with this approach (I have checked)

### Benefits for beginners (if you already have such map):
- Understanding what to learn and in what order
- Easier to google something
- If you forgot the term, but remember it's connections - you can easily find it
- You see the "big picture" of knowledge

### Benefits for the experienced:
- Blind spots of your knowledge become visible
- Fights the illusion of knowledge
- The learning curve gets higher

### Benefits for experts:
- Assistance in the transfer of experience
- Understanding how your expertise relates to other areas of knowledge
